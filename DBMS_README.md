## **Basic DBMS Concepts**

### 1. What is DBMS?
A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that helps in creating, managing, and manipulating databases. It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently.

### 2. Key Features of DBMS:
- **Data Abstraction**: Hides the complexity of how data is stored and maintained.
- **Data Independence**: Changes in database schema do not affect application programs.
- **Security**: Provides security measures to ensure data integrity.
- **Concurrency Control**: Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously without inconsistency.
- **Backup and Recovery**: DBMS supports backup and recovery to prevent data loss.

### 3. What are the different types of DBMS?
- **Hierarchical DBMS**: Data is organized in a tree-like structure.
- **Network DBMS**: Data is organized in a graph and supports many-to-many relationships.
- **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**: Data is organized in tables (most commonly used).
- **Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)**: Data is stored in objects, similar to OOP concepts.

### 4. What is a Database?
A **Database** is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

### 5. What is SQL?
**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the standard language used for managing relational databases. It is used for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting database records.

### 6. ACID Properties:
The **ACID** properties ensure reliable transactions in a DBMS:
- **Atomicity**: The transaction should either complete fully or not at all.
- **Consistency**: Ensures data integrity by maintaining the database in a consistent state.
- **Isolation**: Transactions should not interfere with each other.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, it should remain persistent even in case of system failure.

### 7. Normalization:
**Normalization** is a process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between them.
- **Normal Forms**:
  - **1NF**: Eliminates repeating groups.
  - **2NF**: Removes partial dependencies.
  - **3NF**: Removes transitive dependencies.
  - **BCNF**: Ensures all functional dependencies are removed.

### 8. Keys in DBMS:
- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A key in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.
- **Candidate Key**: A column or combination of columns that can qualify as a unique key.
- **Composite Key**: A key consisting of two or more attributes.

### 9. Indexes in DBMS:
An **Index** is a performance optimization feature in DBMS that allows faster retrieval of records from a table by creating pointers to data.

### 10. Joins in DBMS:
**Joins** are used to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a related column:
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either table.

## **Important Interview Questions and Answers**

### 1. What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
- **DBMS**: Stores data in files and does not enforce relationships between tables.
- **RDBMS**: Stores data in tables with relationships between them, following the principles of normalization.

### 2. What is a primary key?
A **primary key** is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It does not allow `NULL` values.

### 3. What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?
- A **primary key** uniquely identifies each record within a table, whereas a **foreign key** is a reference to the primary key in another table, enforcing a relationship between the two tables.

### 4. Explain ACID properties in detail.
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that transactions bring the database from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that the execution of one transaction is isolated from others.
- **Durability**: Ensures that the results of a transaction are permanently stored, even if the system crashes after the transaction is completed.

### 5. What is a JOIN in SQL and its types?
- A **JOIN** is used to retrieve data from two or more tables based on related columns.
  - **INNER JOIN**: Returns matching rows from both tables.
  - **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right.
  - **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left.
  - **FULL JOIN**: Returns all rows where there is a match in either table.

### 6. What is normalization, and why is it important?
**Normalization** is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by dividing a large table into smaller tables and defining relationships. It ensures that the data is stored logically and efficiently.

### 7. What are the different types of normalization?
- **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Eliminates duplicate columns from the same table.
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Removes partial dependencies on a primary key.
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Removes transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: Handles certain types of anomalies not covered by 3NF.

### 8. What is denormalization?
**Denormalization** is the process of combining multiple tables into a single table to improve read performance. It is typically used in OLAP systems.

### 9. What is a stored procedure?
A **stored procedure** is a group of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. It is stored in the database and can be invoked by calling its name.

### 10. What is a trigger?
A **trigger** is a set of instructions that automatically executes in response to specific events (e.g., insert, update, delete) on a particular table in the database.

### 11. What is indexing, and why is it used?
**Indexing** is a technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval. It creates an index on the columns, allowing faster access to records without scanning the entire table.

### 12. What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?
- **Clustered Index**: Sorts the data rows in the table based on the key and rearranges the physical storage of the data.
- **Non-clustered Index**: Creates a logical order for data using pointers, without altering the physical storage.

### 13. What is SQL Injection?
**SQL Injection** is a security vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data or corruption.

### 14. What is a view?
A **view** is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query. It contains rows and columns just like a real table, but it does not store data itself.

### 15. Explain the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP.
- **DELETE**: Removes specific rows from a table and can be rolled back.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions (cannot be rolled back).
- **DROP**: Deletes the entire table or database structure, and it cannot be undone.

### 16. What are Transactions in DBMS?
A **Transaction** in DBMS is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. Each transaction must maintain ACID properties.

### 17. What are Views?
**Views** are virtual tables that display data from one or more tables based on a query. Views simplify complex queries, enhance security by restricting access, and present a logical organization of data.

### 18. What is a Cursor?
A **Cursor** is a database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and navigate through a result set one row at a time.
