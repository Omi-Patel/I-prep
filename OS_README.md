# Operating System Concepts: Interview Questions and Answers

## Core OS Concepts:

1. **What is an Operating System?**
   - An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the hardware.

2. **What are the types of operating systems?**
   - **Batch Operating System**: Processes tasks in batches, without user interaction.
   - **Time-Sharing Operating System**: Allows multiple users to access the system simultaneously by providing each user with a small time slice.
   - **Distributed Operating System**: Manages a group of distinct computers and makes them appear to be a single computer.
   - **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**: Provides immediate processing and responses, used in embedded systems, aviation, etc.
   - **Network Operating System**: Provides functionalities for network management and resource sharing.

3. **What is a process and a thread?**
   - **Process**: An independent program in execution, with its own memory space.
   - **Thread**: A smaller, lightweight sub-process that shares memory with other threads within the same process.

4. **What is the difference between a process and a thread?**
   - **Process**: Requires its own memory, heavier, and takes more time to create.
   - **Thread**: Shares memory with other threads, lighter, and takes less time to create.

5. **What is deadlock in OS?**
   - **Deadlock**: A situation in which two or more processes cannot proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources.

6. **What are the necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur?**
   - **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can use a resource at a time.
   - **Hold and Wait**: Processes holding resources can request new ones.
   - **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process.
   - **Circular Wait**: A circular chain of processes exists, each waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

7. **What is a process scheduler?**
   - A **Process Scheduler** selects processes from the queue and allocates CPU time to them based on a certain scheduling algorithm.

8. **What are the different types of scheduling algorithms?**
   - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: The first process to request the CPU gets executed first.
   - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: The process with the shortest burst time is executed first.
   - **Round Robin (RR)**: Each process is assigned a fixed time slice.
   - **Priority Scheduling**: Processes are executed based on priority.

9. **What is virtual memory?**
   - **Virtual Memory**: A memory management technique where the OS simulates more memory than is physically available, using disk space as an extension of RAM.

10. **What is paging and segmentation?**
   - **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-sized pages and loads them into frames.
   - **Segmentation**: Divides memory into variable-sized segments based on the logical divisions of a program.

11. **What is thrashing in OS?**
   - **Thrashing**: A condition where excessive paging occurs, leading to high CPU usage but little useful work done, because the system spends most of its time swapping pages in and out.

12. **Explain the concept of a file system.**
   - A **File System** manages how data is stored and retrieved on disk. It keeps track of files, directories, and the storage location of each file.

13. **What is the difference between multitasking, multithreading, and multiprocessing?**
   - **Multitasking**: Running multiple processes on a single CPU.
   - **Multithreading**: Running multiple threads of the same process simultaneously.
   - **Multiprocessing**: Using multiple CPUs to execute multiple processes simultaneously.

14. **What is context switching in OS?**
   - **Context Switching**: The process of saving the state of a currently running process and loading the state of another process. This allows multiple processes to share a single CPU.

15. **What are the different states of a process in an operating system?**
   - **New**: The process is being created.
   - **Ready**: The process is waiting to be assigned to a CPU.
   - **Running**: The process is being executed.
   - **Waiting**: The process is waiting for some event (like I/O).
   - **Terminated**: The process has finished execution.

## Additional OS Concepts:
16. **What is the kernel in OS?**
   - The **Kernel** is the core part of the OS that manages system resources like memory, CPU, and I/O devices, and allows communication between hardware and software.

17. **What is demand paging?**
   - **Demand Paging**: A memory management technique where pages are loaded into memory only when they are needed, reducing the number of pages that must be loaded.

18. **What is the difference between internal and external fragmentation?**
   - **Internal Fragmentation**: Occurs when allocated memory is slightly larger than requested, leaving unused space within allocated regions.
   - **External Fragmentation**: Occurs when free memory is spread out in small blocks between allocated memory spaces.

19. **What are semaphores?**
   - **Semaphores**: Synchronization tools used to control access to shared resources by multiple processes in a concurrent system.

20. **Explain Inter-process Communication (IPC).**
   - **IPC**: A mechanism that allows processes to communicate and synchronize their actions while sharing the same system resources.
