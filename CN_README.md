9. **Common Interview Questions and Answers**

### 1. What is the OSI Model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers:
   1. Physical
   2. Data Link
   3. Network
   4. Transport
   5. Session
   6. Presentation
   7. Application

### 2. Difference between TCP and UDP?
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Connection-oriented, reliable, ensures data delivery (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Connectionless, faster but less reliable (e.g., DNS, VoIP).

### 3. What is Subnetting?
Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller networks (subnets) to efficiently use IP addresses and improve network management.

### 4. Explain DNS and how it works.
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It uses a hierarchy of DNS servers to resolve names.

### 5. How does NAT work?
NAT (Network Address Translation) allows private IP addresses to access the public Internet by mapping private IPs to a public IP address.

### 6. What is a Firewall? Different types of Firewalls?
A firewall is a security device that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic. Types:
   - **Packet Filtering Firewall**
   - **Stateful Inspection Firewall**
   - **Proxy Firewall**

### 7. How does HTTP work?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol for transferring data between a web server and a client. It works using request-response pairs (GET, POST).

### 8. Difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
   - **IPv4**: 32-bit address space, approximately 4.3 billion addresses.
   - **IPv6**: 128-bit address space, provides a vast number of addresses.

### 9. What is ARP and how does it work?
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps a 32-bit IP address to a 48-bit MAC address, allowing devices to communicate over Ethernet.
